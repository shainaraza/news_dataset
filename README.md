# news_dataset
We collected the news data using New York Times API[1] by retrieving the URL of the articles. We used a Python tool [2] that serves as API Wrapper for New York Times to retrieve the comments and other interactions on the news articles. Those interactions were retrieved with respect to the timeline of retrieved news data.

# Interactions on news data
Our news data is uploaded to this repository. The interactions on the news are too large files and can not be uploaded on Git repository due to size limit, so a sample of interaction files matching with the timeline of news data can be accessed via this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f9oy_VjX6gMP1eepQ3VHumkmwmPYBWZ1?usp=sharing
